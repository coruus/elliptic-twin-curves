\section{Preface}

This is a preliminary note of some numerical experiments; the results
may be rather wrong.

\section{Introduction}

Twist-secure curves for elliptic curve cryptography are much in vogue
these days; \cite{curve25519} and others have proposed that twist-security
is an essential safety condition for choosing curves.

\cite{curve25519} cites \cite{KaliskiJCryptology} as introducing the
so-called ``unsafe-twist'' attack,f but I have been unable to find any
evidence either there or in his (quite excellent) thesis, \cite{KaliskiThesis},
that he was aware of this attack.

\section{Elliptic twin curves}

We follow the definitions of \autocite{ShparlinskiSutantyo}, with some minor
modifications.

Let $\Ej$ be the elliptic curve of invariant $j$, and $\Ejfq$ be its reduction
over a finite field of characteristic $p > 5, n \geq 1$ with $p$ prime. Let
and $t(\Ejfq)$ be the trace of Frobenius of that elliptic curve.

Let $\Ejfqt$ be the non-trivial quadratic twist of $\Ejfq$ over the same field.

An \emph{elliptic twin} is a pair consisting of a prime $p$, and two primes
not equal to $p$ or $0$, $(p, {l, r})$ such that

\begin{equation}
\#\Ejfp \#\Ejfpt = l + r = 2 p + 2 - l + r
\end{equation}

It is clear that there exist elliptic twins over arbitrary prime fields, but
the formulae of \autocite{ShparlinskiSutantyo} are not amenable to characterizing
local fluctuations in the density of such elliptic twins holding the finite
field fixed.

\section{Primes}

We consider the non-Mersenne SECP primes, standardized for the use of the
federal government in \cite{recur}, which are, where $N \coloneqq 2^{32}$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \Pa &= N^7 - N^3 + N^0                \\
    \Pb &= N^8 - N^7 + N^6 + N^3 - N^0    \\
    \Pc &= N^{12} - N^4 - N^3 + N^1 - N^0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

They are subset of the class of Generalized Mersennes defined by
\autocite{Solinas}.

%\autocite{grangermoss},

In future work, we plan to extend the study to consider the more general question
of the distribution of group structure and curve exponent for the reduction of
curves over fields for which the number of points is non-prime, and apply similar
techniques with respect to the two curves proposed for IETF use, the nearly-Mersenne
$\Pd = 2^{255}-19$ and the Hamburg-Solinas trinomial $\Pg = 2^{448}-2^{224}-1$.
\footnote{The Hamburg primes are ``Karatsuba-friendly'' \cite{Hamburg}, who was the
first to publish an algorithm that fully takes advantage of their special form.}

(We probably won't extend this work to the Mersenne $\textup{M}_{521}$, as that
particular calculation is pestiferously large.)

\section{Numerical methods}

\subsection{Finding prime-order curves}

A slightly modified version of PARI/GP was used to calculate the
traces of prime-order curves, based on code of \cite{Hamburg}.
(The particular code used for this version of this paper may be
found at \autocite{junkpari}.) Point-counting was aborted early
if $\#\Ej$ was found to have a small prime factor.

\subsection{Range} 

We calculate \Tf for each \Ej for $0 < j < 2^{20}, j \neq 1728$, then
test $\#\Ej$ and $\#\Ejt$ for (pseudo-)primality.

(For this to be a reasonable procedure, it requires the assumption that
$j$-invariant is not correlated with the probability of the curve being
an elliptic twin, even on a local scale of $2^{20}$.)

\subsection{Results} 

\begin{tabular}[l]{l|lll}
      & $N_{\pi}$ & $N_{\pi'}$ & $N_{\pi'} / N_{\pi}$ \\
  \Pa & 2790 & 31 & 1.1e-2 \\
  \Pb & 1956 & 15 & 0.8e-2 \\
  \Pc & 1131 & 20 & 1.8e-2 \\
\end{tabular}

\section{Future work}

Because the above method results in fairly low precision in estimating
$N_{\pi'} / N_{\pi}$ because of the small number of doubly-prime curves,
we plan to use two slightly different methods, essentially similar to those
of \autocite{ShparlinskiSutantyo}.

\emph{Procedure 1.} We generate $N$ random $j$-invariants,
$(j_{0,0}, \ldots, j_{N,0})$, and increment each by 1 until we
find a doubly prime curve.

\emph{Procedure 2.} We generate random $j$-invariants repeatedly until we collect
N primes.

The procedure we will use to generate the random $j$-invariants is, for both procedures,

{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
for i in range(N):
  ok = False
  while not ok:
    input = shake256("Elliptic Twins over GF(0x%x),
                     procedure %u: i=%u, try=%u".format(procedure, P, j, try))
    maybep = l2b(shake256.squeeze(bitlen / 8))
    if maybep < P:
      ok = True
  js[i] = maybep
\end{verbatim}
}

and similarly for procedure 2.

\section{Concluding, mostly irrelevant aside}

The quantity $1 / \p(p) = N_{\pi}(\p) / N_{\pi'}(\p)$ is an estimator for
the number of trials required, when choosing a prime curve uniformly at
random in $\BbbF_q$ for that curve to be an elliptic twin.

The probability, however, that no elliptic curves in a set of $N$
are elliptic twins is, of course,

\begin{equation}
1 - \lparen \prod_{0 \leq i < n} 1 - \p_q \rparen
\end{equation}

With respect to the curves generated by the NSA for SECP, and
subsequently standardized by NIST, this calculation gives a probability
of very approximately $< 5\%$ of any of the curves over $\Pa, \Pb, \Pc$
being elliptic twins.

A Bayesian might thus conclude that it is more likely than not that
the NSA's curves were not generated by a process that samples from
a uniform distribution on prime-order curves over the chosen prime
fields.

This suggests that the NSA's choice of seeds for the ``random'' prime
curves were subject to additional safety criteria not yet publicly
disclosed. (Or, of course, things with 10\% probability do happen quite
frequently.)

In addition, it suggests that the fever for ``twist-security'' which
has taken grip of the cryptographic community is potentially dangerous:
These are a small class of elliptic curves, and there is no evidence that
-- provided an implementation is not vulnerable to a small-twist attack --
they possess \emph{less} structure than a non-twist-secure curve.

\section{Acknowledgments}

The patch to PARI/GP used is derived from a patch by Michael Hamburg.

All of the non-trivial mathematics is entirely derived from prior work by
Robert Ransom, Igor Shparlinski, and others. The only novelty, if it can
be called that, is in the application to this particular question.

This table is adapted (read stolen directly) from \cite{safecurves}.
Curves for which the cofactor is minimal in either Weierstrass or
Edwards form are highlighted.
