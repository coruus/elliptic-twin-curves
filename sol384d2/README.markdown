# NOTE

These results, though they are a relatively large sample of curves
reduced over P-384, are incomplete: They are the first 120 of a set
of 1000.

Please don't try to interpret the data too much.

which is a (bad) estimator for the probability of a randomly selected
curve being an elliptic twin. (It is *not* the probability, given
that a curve has prime order, of that curve being an elliptic twin.)

This data is more useful for estimating the number of curves that need
to be examined in order to find an elliptic twin, as a rough metric for
the amount of computation needed to achieve a target sample size.
